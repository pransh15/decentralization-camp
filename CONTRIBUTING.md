# Contributing to Decentralization Camp

Hi, Rebels! Oh wait, contributors. :laughing:

Well, you're rebellious and you want the internet back or at least don't want it to be centralized and one-tracked, so do we!
We're glad that you're here, we like-minded open source enthusiasts are going to help make the web decentralized!

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Decentralization Camp :tada:! 

Decentralization Camp is important and really close to us because we strongly feel against what the current scenario is, and the steps that are being taken. This is not anger or frustration, it's to save the world however we can. Feel like a superhero already? It's because you are if you help us make this happen!

But, we won't let that happen. With your help, we are going to **spread the word**, **make things happen** and make the web **OURS!**


Although we need help from the most basic of things to the most advanced sectors, read ahead to know where you can contribute.
