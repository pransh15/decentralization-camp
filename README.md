## Introduction
For more than a decade, the world has been on the internet and it has evolved to become something really amazing. It's full of resources, knowledge, people and, **cat videos**.

We all have been a part of the internet, and making it what it is, and now as the scenario's changing we need to stop it. We need the web to be open, and nobody can take it away from us! Call it the need of the hour, or an ambitious project, we have to try!

We plan to make this a one-stop shop for someone to understand these things:

- What is Open Web?
- How is the internet getting centralized?
- What will happen if we let it be centralized?
- Why should they know?
- How can they be a part of it?

## Why do we need to do this?
It's simple, the Open Web needs to be Open and it's in our hands and we, as the builders of the web have some responsibilities towards it.

Here's a [ great blog ](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/inside-the-invisible-war-for-the-open-internet-dd31a29a3f08) by [ Quincy Larson from Free Code Camp ](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/@quincylarson) to help you realise the gravity of the situation we are in!

## How do we plan to do this?

We are trying to reach as much people as we can and making this the only link one would need to know everything about it and start somewhere.

## How can you help?

You can make graphics, memes, write blogs, do petitions, get us a reach, discuss with us what's necessary and what's not, review us, make websites and if nothing else urge people, Tweet about it or post it on Facebook so that we get as much suport as we need to keep this web an Open one.

So, if you're not any one of the ones mentioned above, doesn't matter! Drop in and say hi, make us better and feel free to discuss!
